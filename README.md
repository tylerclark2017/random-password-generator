# random-password-generator

## Project Explanation
This project is meant to teach us how to use JavaScript to create a simple random password generator. This project forces us to use what we learned throughout the week, including storing variable declarations to create the letters, numbers, and special characters to decide what will be included in the randomly generated password. It also exposed us to functions, which in this case, is used to generate the password based on what the user selects (should the password include uppercase and/or lowercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters). We also had to use a for loop, which in this case, is used to select random letters and numbers and characters to create the password for the user. We also had to utilize the console.log, which logs the generated password to the console in DevTools and also in the application as well. Lastly, we had to add an eventListener to the "Generate" button on the webpage, which, in this case, when the user clicks on the "Generate" button, generates the random password given the parameters the user selected. 

## Disclosures
I did use the Xpert Learning Assistant to help guide me in this process, ensuring that the code I used was accurate. It helped me create the function generatePassword and the resulting code inside the function, as well as the equators needed to finalize the if statements in the preceding var characterSet.
